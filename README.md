## Sync.py

#### Description:
* The script synchronizes two directories - the source and the replica. 
* Synchronization is one-way, the contents of the replica directory are converted to the contents of the source.
* Copy and delete operations are logged to a file and output to the console.

* The paths to directories, the synchronization interval and the path to the log file are set by command line parameters when starting the program.

#### Technologies used:
* Only standard Python libraries are used.
